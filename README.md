# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

A Theatrical Fundraiser is looking to research how different plays compare in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. The Fundraiser (Louise) came up just short of her goals at her most recent event and is wondering if her launch date or funding goals could play a role in future event planning. In Order to achieve the clients’ goals, we will determine success rates based on time and year and financial goals. 

### Purpose

The Purpose of this project was to deliver two technical Analysis’s comparing event success/failure/cancelation to both Launch Date and Financial Goals. In order to visually represent the results two chart were produced; Outcomes Based on Goals, and Outcomes Based on Launch Date. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Two charts were produced in order to visualize the success and failure rates of plays according to both time of year and fundraising goals. Some challenges were presented in representing financial goals as data encompassed a wide range.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

For the Outcomes Based on Launch Date Chart we found the number of events and sorted them into Successful/Failed/Canceled categories for each month, percentages were calculated for each Category and Month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

For the Outcomes Based on Goals Chart we sorted financial goals from $1,000 to $50,000 into brackets. The percentages of success/failure were calculated using the total in each data range. Some challenges were presented here as financial goals showed a wide range. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Difficulties were not too present in this current analysis; however, it should be noted that not all variables (ex. weather, location, advertising) were account for in the analysis and the results may not provide comprehensive information.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Two Conclusions we can draw in reviewing the Outcomes Based on Launch Date are that events Launched in May had the Highest Potential for success. In December we see that the total number of events decreased as well as the number of successful events. Based on this information a May Launch is recommended. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

Two Conclusions we can draw in reviewing the Outcomes Based on Goals are that first most projects fall in the $1000-$4,999 range, and that the same bracket also boasts second in success percentage. Based on these finding goal range in this bracket is recommended. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The number of projects dropped off dramatically as cost increased, therefore there was not enough data to accurately conclude the success of very high goal events. Also, not all variables (ex. weather, location, advertising) were account for.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

It would be beneficial to the client to research any events that may have been affected by weather, as well as location of the event and advertising dollars spent to advertise the event, this could all provide valuable data to help guide the next events production more accurately.
